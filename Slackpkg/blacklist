# This is a blacklist file. Any packages listed here won't be
# upgraded, removed, or installed by slackpkg.
#
# The correct syntax is:
#
# To blacklist the package xorg-server-1.19.4-x86_64-1 the line will be:
# xorg-server
#
# DON'T put any space(s) before or after the package name or regexp.
# If you do this, the blacklist will NOT work.

#
# Automated upgrade of kernel packages aren't a good idea (and you need to
# run "lilo" after upgrade). If you think the same, uncomment the lines
# below 
#
#kernel-generic
#kernel-generic-smp
#kernel-huge
#kernel-huge-smp
#kernel-modules
#kernel-modules-smp
#kernel-source

#
# aaa_elflibs should NOT be blacklisted!
#

# You can blacklist using regular expressions.
#
# Don't use *full* regex here, because all of the following 
# will be checked for the regex: series, name, version, arch, 
# build and fullname.
#
xf86-video-nouveau
# This one will blacklist all SBo packages:
