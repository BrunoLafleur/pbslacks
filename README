Those are somme scripts which download the latest Linux Slackware current
distribution and my preferred add-ons packages.

=================================================================
For a fresh install from a USB stick do :
-on a working computer with a working system with a Bourne shell terminal
like bash (on Linux or MS Windows or ...)
-with internet acces
-in a newly created repository like Slackware_date in the same directory as pbslacks

> cd Slackware_date
> ../pbslacks/paspireinit

Then in sequence or in parallel if the network is good enough.
> pbslacks/pbaspire
> pbslacks/pbaspirealien
> pbslacks/pbaspireponce
> pbslacks/pbaspireslonly
> pbslacks/pbaspireother

Then do a USB stick (a 16 Go or above one) as root (admin user) :
> cd slackware64-current/usb-and-pxe-installers
> /usbimg2disk.sh -f -i `pwd`/usbboot.img -o /dev/sdXXX (device de la clé à trouver avec dmesg) -s `pwd`/..
> cd ../..

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Then install the Slackware current with this new USB stick and reboot on it (see SLACKWARE.txt)

Then do on the USB stick or a copy on a central/local repository as root :
> pbslacks/pbupgrade -new

and recompile some packages as root :
> pbslacks/pbinstallpost

If you have a dual graphic card on a Laptop with NVIDIA as root :
> pbslacksinstallbumblebee

=================================================================
For updating one installed Slackware current to the latest downloaded with :
> ../pbslacks/pbaspireinit
> pbslacks/pbaspire

Or an old local USB or central disk repository can be updated with (have to be tested) :
> pbslacks/pbaspire -sync

> pbslacks/pbaspirealien
> pbslacks/pbaspireponce
> pbslacks/pbaspireslonly
> pbslacks/pbaspireother

-----------------------------------------------------------------
On the installed Slackware current to update,
lauch the following scripts on the USB key or a disk copy of it on a central repository
on the new machine as root.
> pbsclacks/upgrade

And if you have the dual graphic cards as root.
> pbslacks/pbupgradebumblebee

After upgrade, you can recreate and install some packages as root.
> pbslacks/pbinstallpost

And if you have the dual graphic cards as root.
> pbslacks/pbinstallbumblebee

If you install that Slackware on other computers, the pbinstall* needs to be done only for the first one.
=================================================================

Those script are not standalone for now. Some packages were preloaded in my
local repository. I will have better scripts in some future.

Those scripts uses slackpkg and wget.

I have tested with Slackware current of july 2019, aout 2019 and december 2019.
