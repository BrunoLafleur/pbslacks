This tool has been write in totality by the above author.

Those are some scripts which download the latest Linux Slackware current
Intel 64 bits distribution and my preferred add-ons packages.

They also upgrade an already installed current Slackware.

An iso image can also be done which include the resulting downloaded
Slackware and her add-ons.
It can be put on a USB stick or a double layer DVD Rom.

It can be a multi-boot USB stick with the installable Slackware and
the GParted live iso.

=================================================================
For a fresh install from a USB stick do :
-on a working computer with a working system with a Bourne shell terminal
like bash (on Linux or MS Windows or ...) and the wget program.
-with internet acces.
-in a newly created repository like Slackware-x64-date in the same directory
as pbslacks (pbsetup create it).
-if there is an old Slackware-x64-date in the same parent directory, the
distribution and the add-on packages are copied and not fetched again if there
were not upgraded.

 > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose aspire in the displayed menu
   ----------------          ------
or> XDATE=`date '+%Y%m%d'`
  > mkdir Slackware-x64-$XDATE
  > cd Slackware-x64-$XDATE
  > ../pbslacks/pbaspire

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to get.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

Then do a USB stick (a 16 Go or above one) as root (admin user - pbsetup
will ask for the root password), with the
current repository just downloaded / updated or
with a slackware iso downloaded or made with the pbmakeiso below :

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose makeusb in the displayed menu
    ----------------          -------
or> pbslacks/pbmakeusb

You can also do an iso image as a normal user :
  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose makeiso in the displayed menu
    ----------------          -------
or> pbslacks/pbmakeiso

You can put this iso on a USB stick (as root or a user in the plugdev group) :
  > pbslacks/pbmakeiso2usb
or> pbslacks/pbmakeusb -iso image_slackware.iso

Those generated iso need a double layer media for being put on a DVD
with your favorite record software.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Then install the Slackware current with this new USB stick
and reboot on it (see SLACKWARE.txt)

Then do on the USB stick or a copy on a central/local repository as root (pbsetup
will ask for the root password) :
  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose upgrade in the displayed menu
    ----------------          -------
or> pbslacks/pbupgrade -new

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to add.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

=================================================================
For updating a cloned Slackware current repository to the latest.
Download again (only the differences as we do with wget -N)
on a fresh or existant USB or central/local repository :

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose aspire in the displayed menu
    ----------------          ------
or> ../pbslacks/pbaspire

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to get.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
On the installed Slackware current to upgrade,
lauch the following scripts on the USB stick or a disk copy of it on a central
repository on the new machine as root (pbsetup will ask for the root password).

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose upgrade in the displayed menu
    ----------------          -------
or> pbsclacks/upgrade

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to add.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

=================================================================

Those scripts uses slackpkg, wget and udisks2.

The web links used for the aspire are in the pbpathinc file.
                                             ---------
Modify it if you want another mirror or change some versions of packages.

The screen tool is used for the pbupgrade script.
    ------                      ---------
If your console or X-Window terminal breaks, you can recover it with
  > screen -r from another console as long as your machine is alive.

The sets of add-ons packages are consistants. They include the necessary
dependencies as long as you have installed the whole official Slackware
current with the help of the pb* scripts or by hand.
In particular desktop environments or multimedia softwares are very dependant
of a lot of packages which should be present on your system.

I have put some python2 packages of mine because the current Slackware tends to
remove,the Python 2 bindings. In particular, the Openshot 1.4 version I use
needs them.

It is better to update your clone of this pbslacks project before downloading and
installing the latest current Slackware. I may have done some little patches or
adjustement.

=================================================================

There is some MS Windows .bat files and tricks in the windows subdirectory.
See also the doc/SLACKWARE.txt text file which explain the dual-boot install by
hand (the same you can do with the pbsclacks/pbsetup master script).

They are useful and have been tested with MS Windows 7 to 10 for dual-boot
installations with MS Windows and Linux.

Note that it can be a way for a lot of non geeks people to promote Linux.
It reassure people even if the won't ever use the MS Windows installed of their
computer.

=================================================================

I have tested with Slackware current of july 2019, aout 2019, december 2019,
january 2020, ... The last one I synchronize is dated 20 november 2020.
