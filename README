Those are some scripts which download the latest Linux Slackware current
Intel 64 bits distribution and my preferred add-ons packages.

They also upgrade an already installed current Slackware.

An iso image can also be done which include the resulting downloaded
Slackware and her add-ons.
It can be put on a USB stick or a double layer DVD Rom.

It can be a multi-boot USB stick with the installable Slackware and
the GParted live iso.

=================================================================
For a fresh install from a USB stick do :
-on a working computer with a working system with a Bourne shell terminal
like bash (on Linux or MS Windows or ...) and the wget program.
-with internet acces.
-in a newly created repository like Slackware-x64-date in the same directory
as pbslacks.
-if there is an old Slackware-x64-date in the same parent directory, the
add-on packages are copied and not fetched again if there were not upgraded.

 > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose aspire in the displayed menu
   ----------------
or> XDATE=`date '+%Y%m%d'`
  > mkdir Slackware-x64-$XDATE
  > cd Slackware-x64-$XDATE
  > ../pbslacks/pbaspire

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to get.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

Then do a USB stick (a 16 Go or above one) as root (admin user), with the
current repository just downloaded / updated or
with a slackware iso downloaded or made with the pbmakeiso below :

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose makeusb in the displayed menu
    ----------------
or> pbslacks/pbmakeusb

You can also do an iso image as a normal user :
  > pbslacks/pbmakeiso

You can put this iso on a USB stick (as root or a user in the plugdev group) :
  > pbslacks/pbmakeiso2usb
or> pbslacks/pbmakeusb -iso image_slackware.iso

Those generated iso need a double layer media for being put on a DVD
with your favorite record software.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Then install the Slackware current with this new USB stick
and reboot on it (see SLACKWARE.txt)

Then do on the USB stick or a copy on a central/local repository as root :
  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose upgrade in the displayed menu
    ----------------
or> pbslacks/pbupgrade -new

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to add.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

=================================================================
For updating one installed Slackware current to the latest
Download again (only the differences as we do with wget -N)
on a fresh or existant USB or central/local repository :

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose aspire in the displayed menu
    ----------------
or> ../pbslacks/pbaspire

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to get.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
On the installed Slackware current to upgrade,
lauch the following scripts on the USB stick or a disk copy of it on a central
repository on the new machine as root.

  > pbslacks/pbsetup # Choose upgrade in the displayed menu
    ----------------
or> pbsclacks/upgrade

This script has a dialog menu which permits to choose packages to add.
It can also launch some other scripts from this project.

=================================================================

Those scripts uses slackpkg, wget and udisks2.

I have tested with Slackware current of july 2019, aout 2019, december 2019,
january 2020.
