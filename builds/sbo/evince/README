evince (a simple gtk-based document viewer)

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop 
with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* DjVu
* TIFF
* CBR/CBZ (comic books)
* DVI (requires optional dependency texlive)
* XPS (requires optional dependency libgxps)

This uses dconf (runtime-only) to save various settings (and even 
then, not ALL settings are saved).

Note: this is the last version I could get to compile and run on Slackware
14.2. Newer versions of evince require newer glib2 and gtk+3 libraries
than 14.2 provides, so please don't email me asking for updates (you'll
have to wait until Slackware 15.0 is released).
