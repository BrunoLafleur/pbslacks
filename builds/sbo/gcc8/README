This gcc8 package can be installed alongside Slackware's gcc packages.

How to use these gcc8 compilers instead of Slackware's default C and C++?
Simple:
In your console or terminal, you 'source' the provided profile script,
like this (a c-shell compatible script is available as well):

  source /etc/profile.d/gcc8.sh

The command 'source' is equivalent to the dot command ' . '.
The profile script will (re-)define the common variables that are used
by make and other programs to determine which binary to run as the compiler:

export CC=gcc-8
export CPP=cpp-8
export CXX=g++-8
export AR=gcc-ar-8
export NM=gcc-nm-8
export RANLIB=gcc-ranlib-8

Nothing else needs to be done after sourcing the profile script.
All you do next is run your compile job as usual in that same console.
Your program will be compiled with the binaries provided by the gcc8 package.
