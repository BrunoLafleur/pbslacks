firejail

Firejail is a SUID security sandbox program that reduces the risk of security
breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted applications using
Linux namespaces. It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own
private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack,
process table, mount table.

Firejail can sandbox any type of processes: servers, graphical applications, and
even user login sessions. Written in C with virtually no dependencies, it should
work on any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel version.

I have added a globals.local and a chromium.local files.
For audio to work on Slackware current with pulseaudio (xdg setup).
And more secure profile for chromium in cas we use --no-sandbox.

You should also be sure XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is enable either with /etc/profile.d
or in pam.
