# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

colibri: colibri (an alternative to KDE4 Plasma notifications)
colibri:
colibri: Colibri notifications look lighter and are completely passive: they 
colibri: do not provide any buttons. You may or may not like this.
colibri:
colibri: Since they are completely passive, they smoothly fade away when you
colibri: mouse over them, allowing you to interact with any window behind
colibri: them. They also do not stack each others: if multiple notifications
colibri: happen, they will be shown one at a time.
