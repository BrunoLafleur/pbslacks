Qt is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.
This script packages version 4.x together with qtwebkit,
parallel-installable with qt5.

From the original SlackBuild script which works well for KDE4 compilation and
other packages which depends on QT4 :
  All other distros I checked build with -no-webkit. But this has the downside of
  breaking the build when QtWebKit is present on the build system and some things
  (assistant for one) are built without support for QtWebKit. So let's go with
  -webkit and remove the built files later from the package. -HW

Uses 2000 Mo on /tmp or $TMP to compile.
