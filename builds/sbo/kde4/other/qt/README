Qt is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.
This script packages version 4.x together with qtwebkit,
parallel-installable with qt5.

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and
JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from
KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their
porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent.
QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back
to Qt.

This dual bundled package is necessary for the compilation of KDE4 which
don't finish without qtwebkit. Also at runtime, missing qtwebkit libs stop
KDE4 from working.

From the original SlackBuild script which works well for KDE4 compilation and
other packages which depends on QT4 :
  All other distros I checked build with -no-webkit. But this has the downside of
  breaking the build when QtWebKit is present on the build system and some things
  (assistant for one) are built without support for QtWebKit. So let's go with
  -webkit and remove the built files later from the package. -HW
