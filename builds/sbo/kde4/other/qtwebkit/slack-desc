# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

qtwebkit: QtWebKit (Qt bindings for the WebKit browser engine)
qtwebkit:
qtwebkit: WebKit is an open source web browser engine. WebKit's HTML and
qtwebkit: JavaScript code began as a branch of the KHTML and KJS libraries from
qtwebkit: KDE. As part of KDE framework KHTML was based on Qt but during their
qtwebkit: porting efforts Apple's engineers made WebKit toolkit independent.
qtwebkit: QtWebKit is a project aiming at porting this fabulous engine back
qtwebkit: to Qt.
