xvkbd is a virtual (graphical) keyboard program for X Window System
which provides facility to enter characters onto other clients
(softwares) by clicking on a keyboard displayed on the screen. This may
be used for systems without a hardware keyboard such as kiosk terminals
or handheld devices. This program also has facility to send characters
specified as the command line option to another client.

It is added to the gdm desktop manager by putting the custom file in this
directory in /etc/X11/gdm/Init
It is called by /etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default

The keyboard layout can also be changed with :
cp /etc/X11/app-default/XVkbd-lang /etc/X11/app-default/XVkbd

Or dynamically with the left bottom button.
