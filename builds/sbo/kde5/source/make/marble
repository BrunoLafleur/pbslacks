#
## Marble's cmake left us in build_qt4,
## so we build and install Qt4 support first:
#make $NUMJOBS || make || exit 1
#make install DESTDIR=$PKG || exit 1
## Move the marble4 cmake file so that it will be found:
#mkdir -p $PKG/usr/share/apps/cmake/modules
#mv $PKG/usr/share/marble/cmake/FindMarble.cmake \
#  $PKG/usr/share/apps/cmake/modules/FindMarble.cmake
## Rename the marble4 include dir to avoid a conflict with marble:
#mv $PKG/usr/include/marble{,4}
## And fix that include path in the cmake file too:
#sed -i $PKG/usr/share/apps/cmake/modules/FindMarble.cmake \
#    -e 's,marble/MarbleModel.h,marble4/MarbleModel.h,'
#
## Go back to build_qt5 and build/install the Qt5 support:
#cd ..
## Fix installation of the designer plugins - only a problem for the Qt5 libs:
#sed  -i CMakeLists.txt \
#     -e 's,LIB_SUFFIX}/plugins,LIB_SUFFIX}/qt5/plugins,g'
#cd build_qt5
#

# Fix installation of the designer plugins:
sed  -i ../CMakeLists.txt \
     -e 's,LIB_SUFFIX}/plugins,LIB_SUFFIX}/qt5/plugins,g'
make $NUMJOBS || make || exit 1
make install DESTDIR=$PKG || exit 1
