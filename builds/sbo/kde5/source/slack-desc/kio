# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kio: file dialog also use this to provide network-enabled file management.
kio: It supports accessing files locally as well as via HTTP and FTP out of
kio: the box and can be extended by plugins to support other protocols as
kio: well. There are a variety of plugins available, e.g. to support access
